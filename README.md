### About the repo

This repo holds the code for my analysis of what the hottest villages in Kerala are. You can read the analysis on my blog [here](https://shijith.com/blog/kerala-panchayat-temp/).

All the code you need to reproduce my results is in the [jupyter notebook](code_final.ipynb). But before you do that, you will need to request an account at Microsoft's [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/).

Once that's done, you can upload the jupyter notebook to your Planetary Computer [home directory](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/environment/#understanding-the-file-system) and run it from there. (Another option is to store the notebook locally but have it run code remotely on the server. This is what I've been doing [through Visual Studio Code](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/ui-vscode/).)

The notebook is heavily commented, so a coder with enough time should be able to read it from top to bottom, and understand atleast at a high level what's going on.

### Want to hire me?

Have a look at [my website](https://shijith.com/). If you like what I've done and think I could be of value to your company, email me at [mail@shijith.com](mailto:mail@shijith.com) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shijith/). I won't make sense for a full-fledged developer role, but if you have something that combines coding and longform writing, I'm definitely a good fit for that. Get in touch! :)
